## About Deployment

Currently, the deployed backend may spin down due to inactivity as part of the free tier subscription. When you open the deployed system, you may experience some loading time as it needs to wait for the backend to restart.

## Getting Started

First, run the client development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then, run the server development:

```bash
npm start
```
